title: Notion

---
I have been using notion since about October of 2019. To my friends annoyance I have been trying to convert people over to notion for their every day tasks and so far I managed to impress one person. I find it hard to explain "why you would use notion" and then I quickly would realize that not many people I know use any kind of documentation software so I quickly dropped sharing this in my close friend group. But after getting used to this and fighting everything I knew about documentation software intuitively I have finally come to a comfortable relationship with this amazing software.

I've never used a note taking software to be honest so maybe my learning path will be different to many other people. When I started using notion it felt very alien, I did not see its full potential but yet I decided to stick to it because notion provides a lot of templates and examples to work from and slowly, one by one, page by page I started to create my first personal workspace.

### Pages within pages

I am in love with this system. Anything and everything can be a page with a pretty icon and title to describe it. You can easily create templates which you can use and reuse (i.e. book review template) as many times as you wish. I love breaking up sections of my life into pages, and then further breaking up sub categories into pages, all aligned and named.

### Customizability

There are many tools provided to users to create all kinds of documentation. You can create a table which you can customize very heavily to suite your needs, for me for example I use it to track my finances and book readings. I use the useful code block snippets to save important code that I need for a project, which means this software is incredibly friendly with developers.

### Conclusion

If you are looking for a powerful note taking app that can load in your previous notes from all (almost) other competitors then I strongly recommend you check it out. Although lacklustre on the mobile application, the desktop application is no doubt best of its kind.
